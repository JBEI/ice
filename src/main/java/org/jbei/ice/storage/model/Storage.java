/**
 * Store sample storage location information as well as the hierarchical structure information.
 * <p/>
 * This class performs two functions. The reasoning will be explained below.
 * <p/>
 * First, this class stores the location information, identified by the name and index fields. For
 * example, a 96 well plate numbered 42 may have name="Plate" and index="42". The plate may have
 * children, say 96 of them. This class does not restrict the number of children, but a controller
 * may look at this class's {@link SampleType} field and determine the minimum and maximum number
 * of children this storage unit can have.
 * <p/>
 * The children of Plate-42 will be 96 wells, with name="Well" and index numbered from "A1" to
 * "H12". When a {@link Sample} is associated with a location,
 * it may in this case point to the
 * Storage object Well-A1. In turn, Well-A1 is held in Plate-42. Conveniently, the name and index
 * can be concatenated to give the user a friendly name, such as Plate-42 and Well-A1.
 * <p/>
 * There is not a limit on the amount of hierarchy a Storage object can have. For example, Freezer-1
 * can hold Shelf-2 which holds Rack-3 which holds Plate-42 which holds Well-A1. In a large freezer,
 * there maybe many Well-A1s, but they all have unique ids (UUIDs) and different parents. The
 * associations can be freely moved around by changing the parent field. For example, Plate-42 maybe
 * moved to Rack-1 from Rack-3, and the children wells would not notice.
 * <p/>
 * Furthermore, there is no limitation on what can be a child of a parent. In a real freezer,
 * Shelf-2 may contain Rack-3 and also a paper box with 81 slots (Call them Box-5, wth Slot-1 to
 * Slot-81), with a tube in each slot (Tube-1138). In this case, a Sample object would be associated
 * with Tube-1138, as that is the object that can be moved between slots or boxes.
 * <p/>
 * Most laboratories have a fixed types of containers, or some scheme of organization. So it would
 * be useful to store some information about the scheme of hierarchy such as
 * Freezer->Shelf->Rack->Plate->Well or Freezer->Shelf->Box->Slot->Tube. Additionally, different
 * entry types may require different storage schemes. For example, plasmids can be stored in tubes
 * or in plates, and seeds can be stored in tubes or boxes.
 * <p/>
 * Therefore, what is needed is also a class for storage schemes with its own parent/child
 * relationships. For example, Plasmid storage scheme can have two child storage schemes, one for
 * plates and other for tubes. But the difficulty lies in that each storage object can have multiple
 * child storage schemes. For example, the shelf of a freezer can contain both racks and boxes, with
 * separate storage schemes. So we work around this by inserting the storage schemes directly into
 * the storage object instead of creating a separate class. Furthermore, if the storage scheme
 * changes, for example insertion or deletion of layers, this does not adversely affect already
 * existing storage hierarchies.
 * <p/>
 * There are other advantages of storing the scheme information directly into the Storage object.
 * And then there are disadvantages. Advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this
 * application. <b>TODO</b>.
