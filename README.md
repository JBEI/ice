## ICE: Inventory of Composable Elements
ICE is a registry platform that provides robust data storage for DNA components, integrated tools for part characterization, as well as mechanisms for secure access and information sharing with other users and software tools.

ICE is open source and distributed under the Modified BSD license. You can try it out at [https://public-registry.jbei.org](https://public-registry.jbei.org) by creating a free account

## Major Features
* Support for storing biological parts in addition to plasmids, microbial strains and *Arabidopsis* seeds. Supported sequence formats are genbank, FASTA and SBOL
* Full text and BLAST search capabilities
* Advanced collection management
* Graphical application and other tool integration for sequence design, annotation and verification
* Real time DNA editing with live vector map display and sophisticated feature annotation
* Opt-in community collaboration capabilities that enable dataset publishing and sharing across multiple ICE instances
* Granular read and write permissions for entries or collections across users and groups 
* Automatic Sequence Annotation

## Installation
### Production
To install in a production environment, please [consult our manual](http://ice.jbei.org/install) for detailed setup and configuration instructions.

### Development
To set up a development environment or local machine installation make sure you have the following dependencies installed
